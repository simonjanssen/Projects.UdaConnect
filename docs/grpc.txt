All gRPC messages and services are globally defined in build/types/definitions.proto
Please also read the README/gRPC section for general information regarding implementation.

The proto file defines a LocationMessage and a PersonMessage and a ConnectionMessage that follow the database schmeas defined in build/types/models.py
It also defines a LocationMessageList and a PersonMessageList and a ConnectionMessageList to pass Locations and Persons as lists betweeen person-service and person-api module.

A ConnectionMessage contains a LocationMessage and a PersonMessage object to uniquely identify a person-to-person connection.

To pass a request from person-api gRPC client to person-service gRPC server additional request message types are defined:
- PersonRequestMessage to query a specific person based on a person id
- LocationIdMessage to query a specific location based on a location id
- ConnectionRequestMessage to query all connections for a specific person, at a specific time and within a specific distance in meters.

All requests are made using the auto-generated definitions_pb2 module. All requests are implemented in the main.py of the person-api module.

The proto file defines four services which are implemented in the person-service gRPC server main.py:
- PersonService.GetPerson: takes a PersonRequestMessage and returns a PersonMessage
- PersonService.GetPersons: takes an EmptyMessage and returns a PersonMessageList
- PersonService.CreatePerson: takes a PersonMessage and returns the same PersonMessage as confirmation
- ConnectionService.GetConnections: takes a ConnectionRequestMessage and returns a ConnectionMessageList
